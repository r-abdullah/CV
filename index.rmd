Hi, welcome to my online CV! 

I am a final year student at the University of Glasgow with a keen interest in data analysis and clinical psychology. I'm eager to enhance analysis skills further and work in medical data science. Previous experience in Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHs) research team has encouraged my interest in seeking opportunities related to this field.
